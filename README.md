# Hangman

## About

1. Game play operates as a regular hangman game.
2. The user can make a guess by selecting a letter.
3. If a guess matches an unknown letter, that letter becomes a known letter.
4. Known letters are displayed in the phrase instead of placeholders.
5. Each guess that does not match an unknown letter counts as a try.
6. The game is over (a loss) when the user accumulates ten (10) tries.
7. The game is over (a win) if all letters of the phrase are known and less than ten (10) tries have been accumulated.
